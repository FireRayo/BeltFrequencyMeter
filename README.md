## 📖 About the project

`BeltFrequencyMeter` is a tool designed to `measure the vibration frequency according to the tension, it essentially works as a guitar tuner, but for belts`.

This project was created to solve `some rubber belts and composite materials cannot operate at any tension; they require a specific working tension`.
